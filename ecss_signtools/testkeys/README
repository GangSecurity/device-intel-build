Test key set for use with the IT enterprise code signing system
(ECSS) to enable devops testing of release signed builds against that
infrastructure. The private key files do not contain valid PKCS #8
blobs. They are wrappers around information needed to call the ECSS.

All key and certificate files are generated using the ./generate
script. If new values are required, ./generate should be updated
and re-run.
