These keys are used for testing the sign_target_files_apks
workflow, as detailed here:

https://android-ia.intel.com/wiki/OTA_Update_Test_Cases

Distribution of these keys is uncontrolled, they are just
for testing the re-signing scenarios.

The passphrase for all these keys is 'uhlersoth'. When running
sign_target_files_apks, set ANDROID_PW_FILE to the pwfile
included here so that passwords aren't prompted.
