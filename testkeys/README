The PK, KEK and DB key pairs are required by UEFI BIOS for secure
boot. The 1st UEFI boot loader should be signed with DB key pairs. and
certificates of PK, KEK and DB should be enrolled into BIOS with the
help either from UEFI applications in the installer or operations in
the BIOS setup menu by the user.

These key pairs are generated for test purposes (secure boot,
OTA...) only with these commands.

development/tools/make_key PK          "/CN=PK/"
development/tools/make_key KEK         "/CN=KEK/"
development/tools/make_key DB          "/CN=DB/"
development/tools/make_key vendor      "/CN=vendor/"
development/tools/make_key oem         "/CN=oem/"
development/tools/make_key odm         "/CN=odm/"
development/tools/make_key OAK         "/CN=OAK/"

Developers and OEMs should provide their own key pairs if they want to
use their own private keys to sign the 1st UEFI boot loader and enroll the
certificates into BIOS. They shall have their own approach to manage
their keys as well.

Various tools may want the keys in PEM or DER format. Right now the
private .pk8 key is in DER and the .x509.pem is in PEM.

To convert private key to PEM:
 openssl pkcs8 -inform DER -nocrypt -in key.pk8 -out key.pem

To convert public key to DER:
 openssl x509 -inform PEM -outform DER -in key.x509.pem -out key.x509

If Intel provides any signed binary to customers (official released binaries),
these test keys shall NOT be used.

The following variables control how images are signed. Unless specified,
defaults to build/target/product/security/testkey

PRODUCT_VERITY_SIGNING_KEY - Key to sign the AOSP boot images

For building EFI executables outside the Android build system using
generate-prebuilts.sh scripts:

DB_KEY_PAIR - Key to sign uefi_shim. DB key for efitools LockDown.efi.
GUMMIBOOT_KEY_PAIR - Key to sign Gummiboot 2nd stage loader. Must be either
    the DB or vendor key. Defaults to vendor.
KEK_KEY_PAIR - KEK key for efitools LockDown.efi
PK_KEY_PAIR - PK key for efitools LockDown.efi
VENDOR_KEY_PAIR - key embedded within shim.efi that can be used to verify
  later boot stages if the DB key is undesirable to use.

You should leave these as defaults and use sign_target_files_apks to use
production keys for releases. Developer builds should always use these
test keys.

BOOTLOADER POLICY:

The bootloader policy is based on two time-based authenticated EFI
variables:
- OAK is the SHA256 of the certificate (OAK.x509.pem)
- BPM is the Bootloader Policy bitMask

These variables are flashed using the "fastboot flash oemvars"
mechanism.  Flash-able files are generated using the
device/intel/build/generate_blpolicy_oemvars script.

If you have already flashed the the OAK and BPM OEMVARS signed with
the wrong odm key you have to delete these variables before you set
the new values.  To do so, you have to generate a delete flash-able
file as follow:

$ device/intel/build/generate_blpolicy_oemvars -K device/intel/build/testkeys/odm \
       -O device/intel/build/testkeys/OAK.x509.pem -B 0x0000000000000000 \
       -D bpc-delete.txt bpc-default.txt

Then flash flash the bpc-delete.txt in fastboot mode:
$ fastboot flash oemvars bpc-delete.txt

Or you can use the testkeys/blpolicy-delete.txt which has been
generated with testkeys/odm and a timestamp far into the future
(2050/1/1).

At build time, the bootloader_policy-oemvars.txt file is generated
based on the keys in device/intel/build/testkeys/[odm,OAK] and
Makefile defined TARGET_BOOTLOADER_POLICY variable (BPM value) using
the generate_blpolicy_oemvars script.  This
bootloader_policy-oemvars.txt is flashed during the device
provisioning.
